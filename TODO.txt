- Change cross-validation code so that during each iteration, 
after the pruning we use the pruned tree to test against the TEST
dataset [refer to notebook]
- Write function to calculate average confusion matrix and 
metrics based on test dataset AFTER the k-fold. k-fold does not
produce a single "best" tree; it simply reports the average of the metrics
